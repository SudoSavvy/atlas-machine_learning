    sentences is a list of sentences to be trained on
    vector_size is the dimensionality of the embedding layer
    min_count is the minimum number of occurrences of a word for use in
    training
    window is the maximum distance between the current and predicted word
    within a sentence
    negative is the size of negative sampling
    cbow is a boolean to determine the training type; True is for CBOW;
    False is for Skip-gram
    epochs is the number of iterations to train over
    seed is the seed for the random number generator
